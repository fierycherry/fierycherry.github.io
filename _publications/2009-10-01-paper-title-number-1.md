excerpt: 'This paper aims to develop an alternative framework to understand copyright based upon a Marxist analysis of this field. By providing bibliographical research on both the fundamentals of property theories and Marxist perspectives, I try to promote another understanding of how creative industries operate. Therefore, the paper provides a literature study on both intellectual property theories and Marxism. Regarding intellectual property theories, I focus on four types of approaches: welfare theory, labour theory, personality theory, and culture theory. In what concerns Marxist perspectives, I explain most fundamental concepts such as "class," "exploitation," and the relationship between classes and the state according to a Marxist view. Then, I try to build a framework that links these concepts. Finally, I employ this Marxist framework to the "modus operandi" of copyright core industries by analyzing how stakeholders interact with each other and to what extent they may affect public policies on copyright and related rights. In the final remarks, I suggest a research agenda on Marxism and copyright. Thus, this is a preliminary exercise to encourage other studies.'
