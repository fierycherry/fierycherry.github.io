excerpt: 'This paper examines the intricate relationships between government officers and interest organisations, a topic receiving less attention compared to their connections with ministers, elected officials, and political parties. Through an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric techniques and qualitative content analysis, the study analyses 415 papers published between 2000 and 2022. It uncovers trends in authorship, research methods, and geographical focus, revealing a concentration of research networks in the United States and Europe, primarily focusing on the 'global North'. The findings highlight a need for further exploration into the causal mechanisms between interest group access to bureaucracy and their influence on public policies. Additionally, the paper proposes new perspectives to analyse these political connections, stressing the importance of more regional diversity in research to develop comprehensive theoretical frameworks applicable across different contexts.'
