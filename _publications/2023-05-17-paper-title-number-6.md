excerpt: 'This study delves into the causal mechanisms underlying issue salience and business influence through a detailed case study on copyright reform in Brazil. I utilised bibliographical and documentary research methods to examine the statuses and legislative agendas of various groups and stakeholders invested in either maintaining or altering copyright laws. By scrutinising public hearings and draft bills discussed within a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies, I mapped out the policy participants and their political inclinations. Employing a combination of process tracing and preference attainment, the analysis aimed to identify the winners and losers in this discourse and the strategies they employed to achieve their objectives. In contrast to previous findings, the case study revealed that certain participants acted as countervailing forces against powerful groups, although business organisations still managed to secure minor concessions.'
