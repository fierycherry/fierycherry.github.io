excerpt: 'The paper examines the concept of democracy and its association with the idea of "people's government," acknowledging its subjective nature leading to diverse interpretations of "government" and "people." It aims to explore discussions on democracy, political equality, and popular sovereignty within contemporary political theory. It introduces a thorough review of various schools of thought including liberal-pluralism, republican views, deliberative theories, participative theory, multiculturalism, feminist theories, and Marxism. By analyzing these perspectives, the paper constructs three clusters to develop models for further analysis of real-world political regimes.'
