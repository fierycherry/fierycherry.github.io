excerpt: 'The paper aims to explore the potential and challenges of studying the politicisation of bureaucracy in Brazil. It incorporates a comprehensive literature review, exploratory data analysis, and three within-case studies of nominations in ministry agencies from 2011 to 2018. The paper identifies gaps in understanding the role of interest groups in appointing high-level nominees and draws upon specialised literature on pressure politics. The analysis of three national secretariats from different policy domains introduces new theoretical insights into classifying and measuring the concept of politicisation. The author hopes that these findings will contribute to studying politics and bureaucracy.'
