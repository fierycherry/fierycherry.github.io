excerpt: 'This paper examines the evolution of Brazil's discretionary bureaucratic positions. It discusses how public office allocation relates to the coalitional presidential system and efforts to professionalise the bureaucracy. Presidential dilemmas arise between coalition support and policy control. Drawing on institutional change theories, it analyses appointment rules and their impact on nominees. Through a Brazil case study, it evaluates theoretical predictions against empirical evidence using bibliographic research, document analysis, and descriptive statistics. Results show non-compliance with appointment rules, high career civil servant presence in discretionary roles, and varying coordination body roles. Despite presidential power centralisation, managers often have freedom in staff selection, underscoring the importance of informal institutions in analysis. The paper provides a contextual account of Brazil and contributes to theory-testing and theory-building on institution-office distribution relationships.'
