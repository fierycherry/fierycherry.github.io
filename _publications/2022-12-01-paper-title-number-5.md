excerpt: 'This paper examines the evolution of Brazil's discretionary bureaucratic system. It explores how the allocation of public offices is influenced by the coalitional presidential system and efforts to professionalise the bureaucracy. The paper addresses presidential dilemmas, which involve choosing between appointing party members to gain support and nominating individuals aligned with the president's policy preferences. Using theories of institutional change as a framework, the study analyses how rules on appointments affect the characteristics of nominees. Through a case study of Brazil, the paper evaluates the alignment between theoretical predictions and empirical evidence regarding institutions and the distribution of public sector posts. Methodologically, it employs bibliographic research, document analysis, and descriptive statistics. The findings reveal that laws regulating appointments were ineffective, as federal organisations did not adhere to them. The number of career civil servants in discretionary roles was already high before mandatory quotas were introduced. The role of coordination bodies varied across administrations. Despite presidential power centralisation, public managers often have autonomy in staff selection and sometimes disregard legal requirements. Hence, the study suggested the inclusion of informal institutions in future analyses, contributing to theory-testing and theory-building on institutional dynamics and public office distribution.'
