Welcome to the kickoff of our blog series! This is the first post in a series that dives into the fascinating world of data science, politics, and personal lived experiences. Today, I'll take you on a journey through my own accidental stumble into data scienceâ€”a journey that's been nothing short of an exhilarating work in progress.

The accident
------
Once upon a time in a small city in Brazil...

There was a postdoc. This postdoc was me, and I was trying to investigate the partisan affiliations of public officers. My research project focused on bureaucrats and their affiliations with political organisations. 

Brazil has more than 30 political parties, and downloading these databases was not easy. Excel opened them, but it was impossible to filter by name to check for specific bureaucrats, as the filtering mechanism froze my screen every time.

That led me to the programming language R.
