The repository contains the collections with selected texts, content analysis, and bibliometrics. Hence, it is useful for those seeking summaries of the state-of-the-art literature in this domain. The research project aimed to systematically map the literature concerning the political affiliations of bureaucrats, particularly examining their interactions with interest groups. Utilising Scopus and Web of Science databases, publications on this topic spanning from 2000 to 2022 were meticulously gathered.<br/><img src='/images/BureaucracyWordCloud.png'>"
