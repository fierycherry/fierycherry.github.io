I have a large experience teaching graduate courses. At the Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar), I was the module leader for Topics in Public Policy: Politics, Bureaucracy, and Interest Groups (2021) and Democracy and Civil Society: Lobbying and Interest Advocacy (2021). In these two cases, I prepared all the materials, selected the readings for the syllabus, coordinated and marked the assignments, and undertook all the administrative tasks besides preparing and giving the lectures. In addition, I co-taught the modules Extreme Right Populism (2020) and Political Theory Seminar (2021). I also co-taught an undergraduate module focused on political institutions. At Aston University, I co-taught the modules The Governance of Global Problems and EuroSim: Learning Negotiation through Simulation Games under the guidance and supervision of Dr Patrycja Rozbicka, senior lecturer. I prepared the materials, helped with assignments, and gave lectures.

Extreme Right Populism (2020)
======
This module provided an introduction to the concepts of populism and anti-establishment politics. It explores the contested notion of populism, examining its three waves in Latin America and its contemporary rise. The module also delves into the perpetual crisis of legitimacy faced by political parties and the relationship between populism and mobilisation. Furthermore, it analyses the intersection of the extreme right, populism, and fascism, considering their impact on parties and the electorate. The consequences of populism and extremism are examined, alongside their challenges to democracy.

Political Theory Seminar (2021)
======
This module focused on political culture and participation, exploring models of political participation and civic voluntarism. It examines cognitive engagement, critical citizenship, institutions, and (neo)institutionalism. The module also covers institutional change, time, and path dependence in political analysis. Additionally, it introduces the field of comparative politics, discussing topics and theories in comparative politics alongside methods used in comparative political analysis

POL308 - Topics in Public Policy: Politics, Bureaucracy, and Interest Groups (2021), UFSCar
======
The central objective of this module was to discuss the concept of politicisation and address the various state and non-state actors involved in the composition of bureaucratic frameworks. This discussion encompasses various topics and concepts, such as state capabilities, bureaucratic autonomy, and patronage. The module was divided into three sections. Part 1 introduced the topic by presenting the fundamental ideas that underlie the general concepts related to the intersections between bureaucracy and the political arena. Part 2 focused on the role of actors and their relationships with bureaucracy, emphasising interest groups, parties, and social movements. Part 3 pertains to the impacts of bureaucracy on public policies. The dynamics of the classes comprised an explanatory part and a second part focused on debates with students. In addition, we had special guests who came to talk about their lived experiences (officers working for the government or members of interest organisations). As the module was taught during the pandemic, the final evaluation required students to produce a podcast episode in which they invited special guests to debate the concepts they learnt during the classes. The episodes are available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3H9zOwf7WncttegfL1odxZ?si=a6b8649470164a88). Students were so engaged that they wrote a book, co-edited by Professor Pedro Floriano Ribeiro, Mariele Troiano, and me. I coordinated all the stages of editing the book, which was published by the State University of Rio and Brazilian Political Science Association ([Link](https://www.martinsfontespaulista.com.br/mosaico-da-burocracia-publica-brasileira-1014769/p))


POL209 - Democracy and Civil Society: Lobbying and Interest Advocacy (2021), UFSCar
======
The present module sought to articulate two sets of research literature: on one side, studies that focus on civil society, participation, and representation, and on the other, research on interest groups, pressure politics, and lobbying. Through dynamic classes and sessions devoted to discussing research methods and tools, the module intends to provide an overview of the analytical possibilities of such topics. Furthermore, by exploring functions related to lobbying, the intention is to equip the class for professional activities associated with the field of government relations. Thus, the content includes a variety of topics related to the role of interest groups, their conceptual debates, and their relationships with the idea of democracy.
The module is divided into three sections. The first covered some of the major theories of democracy, focusing on major traditions in Political Science, such as pluralism, republicanism, and participatory democracy. The second section specifically addressed lobbying and interest groups to introduce concepts and discuss key methodological tools. Additionally, the section aimed to identify similarities and differences between different forms of interest advocacy. Finally, the third section brought together the previous contents to reflect on the role of interest advocacy in contemporary democratic societies. It aimed to problematise the frameworks associated with the term "lobby" and its relationship with debates on democracy, representation, and participation. The module had Dr Patrycja Rozbicka (Aston University) as a guest lecturer, coordinating a negotiation exercise with the students (simulation format). Classes were divided into a debate and a methodological exercise (e.g., data analysis with R). the final evaluation were a negotiation simulation, where students played the role of lobbyists or members of parliament.

LPM108 - The Governance of Global Problems, Aston University
======
This module aimed to critically appraise existing models for addressing global problems. It began with a critical engagement with the two key concepts of globalisation and global governance before assessing different international, transnational, regional, and local strategies for dealing with selected global – or globalised – issues. The main objective was to enable students to evaluate existing models and formulate recommendations for reform.

LPM116 - EuroSim: Learning Negotiation through Simulation Games, Aston University
======
This module sought to explore negotiation techniques and governance through simulation games. Students could put their skills into practice in a simulation game focused on a global conflict. EuroSim is an annual international intercollegiate simulation of the European Union (EU).
