From 2017 to 2018, I was the module leader of three subjects at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Introduction to Political Science
======
The module "Introduction to Political Science" offers an entry point into the field, covering scientific methodologies and a range of theories from classical to contemporary. It provides an overview of political science, examining how it analyses power, governance, and societal structures. The evaluation involves analysing popular culture expressions to identify political concepts, encouraging students to apply theoretical frameworks to real-world examples. Overall, the module aims to familiarise students with the fundamentals of political science and cultivate critical thinking about political phenomena in various contexts.

Contemporary Topics of Political Science
======
Contemporary Topics of Political Science explores current issues like international conflicts and identity. It delves into the complexities of modern political landscapes, analysing factors influencing global relations and societal identities. The module aims to provide insights into pressing political concerns and their implications for governance and international relations.

Contemporary Democratic Theories
======
The module "Contemporary Democratic Theories" delves into modern democratic theories and their connections with classical and modern political philosophy. Students engage in discussions on the works of Dahl and Schumpeter, alongside more recent approaches like identity theories and feminism. The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of contemporary perspectives on democracy, examining its evolution and relevance in today's political landscape.
